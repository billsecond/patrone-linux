# Connection (mstsc) can connect to this VM with clipboard sharing. This does
# the same thing as Settings → System → Remote Desktop. Patrone's own Remote
# Desktop, where each account signs in once with its own password, is the
# patrone-remote-desktop package instead (see remote-desktop/README.md); it
# replaces Remote Login on port 3389.

#   ./setup-remote-desktop.sh login     Remote Login: a separate session sized
#                                       to the client window (resizing it
