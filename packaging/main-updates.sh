# Publishes what's merged into main and not yet in Patrone's apt repository,
# so a merge reaches installs within a day without anyone publishing it by
# hand. Two kinds of package:
#
# - Patrone's own (packaging/*/debian/changelog): each whose version on main
#   is newer than the published one is built (packaging/build.sh).
# - Patrone's builds of Ubuntu's GDM, GNOME Settings, GNOME Software,
#   first-login setup and Language Support: a newer revision of Patrone's
#   changes in gdm/build.sh, gnome-settings/build.sh, gnome-software/build.sh,
#   gnome-initial-setup/build.sh or language-selector/build.sh is built again
#   from the Ubuntu version already published, or Ubuntu's newest for one
#   never published (Ubuntu's own updates to them are ubuntu-updates.sh's).
#
# Then it publishes what built, all at once, and only the debs it has just
# built, never another build in out/ (packaging/publish.sh).
#
#   ./packaging/main-updates.sh            (on the dev VM)
#   ./packaging/main-updates.sh --check    (only say what's behind)
#
# ubuntu-updates.sh runs it daily, in its clean checkout of main. It runs only
# in a checkout of main as it is on GitHub, with nothing changed.
# patrone-installer isn't built here: it needs installer/build.sh first, by
# hand (installer/README.md). A build that fails, and the installer, are said
# in the output (the journal, for the daily run) and become issues in
# billsecond/patrone-apt, which close here once that version, or a newer one,
# is published. A build or publish that fails also ends the run with an error.
